Idea for drawing a thing
=========================
The input is an image that is

* black-and-white (not greyscale)
* 52 pixels wide
* 7 pixels tall, or 6 pixels to be safe

The top row corresponds to Sunday if the image is 7 tall,
or Monday if the image is 6 tall (to be safe). And the
bottom row is Saturday.

The other input is a date in the right-most week; I use
this to align the first input, which is a year of days. 

Then the program figures out what to commit where.
